EnScript
========

EnScript is a proprietary programming language and application programming interface (API) that exists within the EnCase program environment, which means EnCase must be running to run EnScripts. EnScript adheres to the ANSI C++ and Java standards for expression evaluation and operator meanings, making for an easy transition for those accustomed to programming in those languages. Even though EnScript adheres to those standards, only a small subset of C++ features is incorporated. In short, EnScript uses C++ operators and general syntax but uses different classes and functions.
